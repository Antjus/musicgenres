    <h1>What's Lo-Fi?</h1>
<div>

    <p><i>"Lo-Fi is a type of (usually) non-lyrical music that contains origins and influences from Boom-Bap/ New York Underground instrumentals, 1960's and 1070's jazz samples, and electronic music. It's name, Lo-Fi comes from the term "low-Fidelity" which in this case if reference to the sounds of vinyl crackle and sample distortion which is used in a number of ways, namely the provocation of nostalgia, and to distance the sample or melody from any other song with a similar sound. Lo-Fi is primarily composed of a beat (similar to that of a hip-hop beat but with less bass) and looped samples (commonly used samples include piano melodies and clips of Wes Montgomery) most songs are relaxing and evoke positive emotions, often time nostalgia."</i><br>-Urban Dictionary</p>

    <p2><i>"Lofi Girl streams are accompanied by an animation of a girl studying or relaxing who has come to be known as the Lofi Girl, the Lofi Study Girl, or the "24/7 lofi hip hop beats" girl. The channel began using the Lofi Girl for its streams in March 2018.

        Dimitri originally used the character Shizuku Tsukishima from the Studio Ghibli film Whisper of the Heart (1995) as the face of the channel, with footage of her studying or writing used in the streams. When the popularity of the streams ultimately led to channel being taken down for copyright violations, Dimitri decided to maintain the Ghibli-esque aesthetic but with an original character and put out a call for artists"</i><br>-Wikipedia</p2>
